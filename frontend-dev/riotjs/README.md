# RiotJS tags for the Goobi dashboard

This directory holds the riotjs components for the Goobi workflow dashboard.

## Development

To build the components, a recent version of `webpack` is needed. To install `webpack`, you need to first install nodejs and npm. After that, call:

```
npm install -g webpack-cli
```

Then, to start developing, run (in this directory):

```
npm install
webpack
```
